Welcome to the Task List React Web App!

This is my first web application built using React JS. With Task List, users can easily manage their tasks. You can view your tasks, delete them as needed, and even toggle the visibility of tasks. The app provides a helpful visual indicator, with tasks marked as completed displaying a green color. Get organized and stay on top of your tasks with Task List!
